								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Jack14.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Born in Los Angeles on June 21, 2005, Jack was a beautiful child. It quickly became apparent that he was an old soul, preferring to sit and pontificate rather than play with toys. Jack was a great friend and was known for his immense kindness and quick wit.</p>
								<p>Diagnosed with osteosarcoma in August of 2018 at the age of 13, Jack’s life took a different turn. Forced into 3 years of intense treatments and multiple surgeries, Jack remained stoic, using his humor to get through the hard days and entertain the doctors & nurses who took such incredible care of him. Jack was unable to attend school with his peers, but completed his work via an online platform. He maintained & developed friendships through apps such as Snapchat and Twitter where he left his mark and some beautiful content. Jack was an avid online gamer and had a true passion for eSports where he created online content and great friendships within his different gaming communities. The last 3 years of his life were harder than anyone, let alone a child, should have to endure and yet Jack showed those that loved him what a true hero he was. His short life was not in vain. He made a difference and inspired all of us to be better humans. Our lives were made better by knowing him and he will live on in our hearts forever.</p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/Jack4.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>To carry on the legacy of Jack, we have started a Memorial Scholarship in his name. With a passion for ESports, Jack expressed interest in one day becoming a computer programmer, which is why we have decided to give a $500 scholarship to a graduating high-school Senior, or current college student pursuing a degree in a Computer Science or Video Game related field. This scholarship will be given to a student who lives out the mission that Jack was on: <b>To show people that you can do anything, no matter your circumstances, and leave a positive influence on those around you.</b></a></p>
							<p>To encourage more applicants, the founder of this scholarship, Steven (who works as a professional in Cybersecurity) will also be providing networking opportunities and career mentoring to the recipient of this award if they so choose. </a></p>
							<p>We are looking for applicants who deeply want to have an impact on those around them in a positive way. If this is you, please apply for this scholarship <a href="#apply" target="_blank"><b>HERE</b></a> where you will answer a few questions via written response or by submitting a video link. </p>
